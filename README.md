# MATH 4322 Group 1 Project

## Instructions

### Step 1. Download this folder.
In your terminal, navigate to your local directory of interest. I chose my desktop.

Run this command at that location.

```
git clone https://github.com/math-4322-group-1/project.git
```

You should see a folder there named `project`. 


### Step 2. Open the project in RStudio
NOTE: You may need to `git pull` prior to this step if a bunch of people are working on this at the same time.

Using RStudio, click `File` in the top left corner, then `Open File`.

Navigate to the aformentioned `project` folder.

Open the file named `project.Rmd`

This is our project file that you can edit to your hearts content.

### Step 3. Commit and Push your changes.

In the terminal:

```
git pull
git add .
git commit -m "my supercool changes"
git push
```
